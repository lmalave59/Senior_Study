Exploring Imposter Syndrome in Computer Science Students

**Objective**

The goal of this project is to examine how Imposter Syndrome (IS) affects students particularly in computer science (CS) programs compared to non-CS students, such as collegiate baseball players. The study seeks to measure how often students experience impostor feelings, what factors contribute to these perceptions, and how academic and performance environments influence self-confidence, motivation, and mental well-being. I plan on allowing respondents to recieve their scores back if they wish to possibly better understand their personal scenarios.

**Background/Methodology**

Imposter Syndrome refers to persistent feelings of self-doubt and the belief that one’s success is undeserved despite clear evidence of competence (Clance & Imes, 1978). Research has shown that IS is especially common in technical and high-performance fields, including computer science, where constant learning and peer comparison can amplify self-critical thoughts. Prior studies (Rosenstein et al., 2020; Holden et al., 2021; Barari et al., 2024) reveal that more than half of CS students experience moderate to severe impostor feelings often found to be linked to stress, perfectionism, and burnout. Understanding these trends at our local level can inform strategies to improve confidence, inclusion, and student retention in our field's disciplines, but alsdo on a smaller-local scale, our program.

Participants will complete an anonymous Google Form survey that includes:
  The 20-item Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS)
  Additional Likert-style questions exploring academic confidence, stress, and belonging

Recruitment will include as many participants as possible, targeting both CS majors and student-athletes to allow cross-group comparisons. No identifying information will be collected, ensuring full anonymity.
